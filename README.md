# Deep-Learning-for-Fashion-MNIST-Classification

## Overview
A simple deep learning model for predicting labels of handwritten images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset, it must be run in a Linux environment.

## Data: FashionMNIST ([source](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist))

### General

<b>Fashion-MNIST</b> is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

It typically serves as a replacement for the original MNIST dataset containing hand-drawn digits, which is widely regarded for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

### Classes

Each image in the dataset is associated with a label from 1 of 10 classes (given below)

<table>
  <tr> 
    <th>Label</th>	
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
   <tr> 
     <td>0</td>
     <td>T-shirt</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
     <td>1</td>
     <td>Trouser</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
     <td>2</td>
     <td>Pullover</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
     <td>3</td>
     <td>Dress</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
     <td>4</td>
     <td>Coat</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
     <td>5</td>
     <td>Sandal</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
     <td>6</td>
     <td>Shirt</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
     <td>7</td>
     <td>Sneaker</td>
  </tr>
   <tr> 
     <td>8</td>
     <td>Bag</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
     <td>9</td>
     <td>Ankle boot</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Functions

For this program I have included 5 functions (listed below) to build a neural network, train the network, evaluate its performance, and make preditions on test data. 

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>get_data_loader(training=True)</b>: A function to create a Dataloader object for training or testing.<br>
    &emsp;Input: an optional boolean argument (default value is True for training dataset)<br>
    &emsp;Returns: Dataloader for the training set (if training = True) or the test set (if training = False)<br>
    </li>

  <li>
    <b>build model()</b>:A function to build the neural network with the following layers:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>A Flatten layer to convert the 2D pixel array to a 1D array.</li>
      <li>A Dense layer with 128 nodes and a ReLU activation.</li>
      <li>A Dense layer with 64 nodes and a ReLU activation.</li>
      <li>A Dense layer with 10 nodes.</li>
     </ol><br>
    &emsp;Input: none
    &emsp;Returns: an untrained neural network model
 </li>
  
  
  
</ul>
