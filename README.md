# Deep-Learning-for-Fashion-MNIST-Classification

## Overview
A simple deep learning model for predicting labels of handwritten images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset, it must be run in a Linux environment.

## Data: FashionMNIST ([source](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist))

<b>Fashion-MNIST</b> is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

## Functions

For this program I have included 5 functions (listed below) to build a neural network, train the network, evaluate its performance, and make preditions on test data.
